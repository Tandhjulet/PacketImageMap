## Packet Image Maps

Image maps in minecraft 1.8 with built-in image resizing and object-fits.

### Usage
`/setmap <image_filename>.<image_extension> [cover|stretch]`. This command enables image creation for you. After you've selected the two corner points of the image using a stick, you can run the command again, and the image will be created. Optionally, as indicated by the square (`[]`) brackets, you may also provide object fits for the image.

Your generated map will not be removed by commands such as `/killall all`. This way, it can't accidentally be removed by staff members (or alike). Your generated map can also float, but that requires that the item frames are first spawned with a back wall, which is then removed afterwards.

If you want to remove the map, simply left click on it with a stick.

**Have fun!**
